Project Introduction:

In this project, we were given a large dataset of both new and used vehicles from all different types of manufacturers. This notebook aims to perform EDA on the car sales advertisement notebook. The goal is to understand the data, preprocess it, and visualize key insights.

To view app.py running directly from the GitHub directory, click the following link below:

https://vehicles-distribution.onrender.com

You may also run this app locally on your own machine. In order to do so, you must first download the contents of this GitHub directory.

Using your Command Prompt / Terminal, you must use the following command line to determine where you default directory is located:

cd ./

You then must choose which location you will want to change your directory to. Let's say you want to place this this tripleten_sprint4 file into your Documents. You can use the following command line:

cd Documents/sprint-4-project/

Now that you've change directories, you must now create a vertual emvironment. Enter the following command line:

python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>

To activate the virtual environment, enter the following command line:

source <virtual-environment-name>/bin/activate

Now that you have your directory and virtual environment set up, you must now install all the requirements in requirements.txt. Enter the following command line:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once all the libraries and packages are installerd, you may now pass the following command line into your Command Prompt / Terminal:

streamlit run app.py 

You will be given the following link:

http://0.0.0.0:10000 

This is an offline link that is running directly from your machine.

To stop the app from running locally, press ctrl+C into the Terminal.
