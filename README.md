Project Introduction:

In this project, we were given a large dataset of both new and used vehicles from all different types of manufacturers. This notebook aims to perform EDA on the car sales advertisement notebook. The goal is to understand the data, preprocess it, and visualize key insights.

To see app.py running directly from the GitHub directory, click the following:

https://vehicles-distribution.onrender.com

You run this app on your own machine. To do so, you first download the contents of this GitHub directory.

Using your terminal, you use the command line to find where you default directory is located:

cd ./

You then choose which location you will want to change your directory to. The example is my personal:

cd jasminehuynh/sprint-4-project/

Now you're in the right directory, you create a virtual environment. 

python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>

To activate the virtual environment:

source <virtual-environment-name>/bin/activate

Now you install all the requirements in requirements.txt. Enter the command line:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once all the libraries and packages are installed, you can pass the command into your terminal:

streamlit run app.py 

The following link will appear:

This is an offline link that is running from your machine.

To stop the app from running, press ctrl+C into the terminal.
